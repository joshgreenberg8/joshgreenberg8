Hi, I'm Josh Greenberg, a budding data scientist and machine learning engineer. 

I have an extensive academic and profiessional background as a mechanical engineer, but I'm working hard towards a transition into the cutting-edge world of machine learning. 

I recently completed a bootcamp course through Triple Ten (formerly Practicum USA), achieving a Certificate in Data Science & Machine Learning. 

Currently, I'm growing my understanding of neural networks through other resources like the MIT Intro to Deep Learning lectures and associated labs. I'm learning more about different deep-learning architechtures and their strengths, implementations, and challenges.

Most of my recent experience is in Python, using pandas, scikit-learn, and tensorflow among other packages. I am also experienced in SQL and have some limited background with Java and JavaScript.
